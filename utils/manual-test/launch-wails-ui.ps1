.SYNOPSIS
Launch the installed SofCat UI for the interactive Windows smoke test.

.DESCRIPTION
Every run launches as the same interactive user, so WebView2 reuses the same
profile and localStorage (the cached item list and local Activity history)
survives between runs. WebView2 stores that profile beside the executable name
under the launching user's roaming AppData; this script never deletes it.
